BRONX EMS CALLS

Simulating a command line pipeline using the functions, exec() and fork(), that the c method popen() uses.
This program will prompt the user to input which borough they would like to analyze and then the pipeline will search the EMS calls in NYC and determines how many of those calls are coming from the Bronx.
Only a subset of 2000 lines of the data was used since there was a size limit on github.
